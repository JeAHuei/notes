### Privacy-Enhanced Searches Using Encrypted Bloom Filters

#### Research Purposes

To study the data sharing between two or more or more parties who do not fully trust each other. In the paper, our main research is that one party queries few specific documents which belong to other parties.

Roles:

* queries *A*
* providers *B*
* Third party *T*
* warrant server
* index server
* certificate authority

properties:

* Querier gains no knowledge of the contents of the provider's database.
* Provider gains no knowledge of the contents of the querier's queries.
* No third parties gain knowledge of the contents of the queries or database.
* There are some constrints on the queries.

#### Basic idea

We consider the whole process from two parts:

* How to certain the documents that querier want to query
* How to query in a known document

The second part has been studied by many peoples, note as PIR. So we mainly study the first question-*Determine the documents the querier want to query*

##### The basic process

The basic process can be described as follow:

* A encrypted the queries by using her own key, then transmit queries to T.
* T transform A's key to B'key, then transmit them to B.
* When the desired documents are found, B transmit them to A.

Then we mainly talk about several problems in this process.

* Encryption
* Security
* Constraints
* Verification

##### Encryption

When we encrypt Bloom filter, we use the encrypted key to substitute hash functions, such as $H_i(W) = {W}_{k_i}$. 

The encryption needs to satisfy the following conditions:

* Do not distribute keys to other parites. 
* The third party T can transmit keys between different parites.

we can conclude the inverse key $k_i^{-1}$ must exist from the second condition.

1.How to transform encryption element to index?

$index\ set = Enc_k(W) \mod N $

2.How to design key to guarantee inverse key exist?

*Pohlig-Hellman Encryption*

* $\{W\}_k = W^k \mod p$
* Ted knows the ratio key $k_{i,j} = k_j \circ k_i^{-1}$

##### Security

1.When *T* transmit the transformed queries key to B, how to avoid B decrypted?

Process $W$ by using cryptographic hash function *G*, $W' = G(W)$

2.How to prevent B do a dictionary attack?
