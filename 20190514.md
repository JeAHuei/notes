### How to Exchange Secrets with Oblivious Transfer

#### Research background

When we talk about the message exchanged between several parties, we always depend on the third party to guarantee the simultaneous of the process, because these parties do not trust each other. 

So the author mainly provided a protocol so that the two sides do not depend on the third party and keep the simultaneous of the messages exchanged.

#### Main Idea

Define:

* Alice and Bob
* Alice's file: the file that Alice wants but its password belongs to Bob
* Bob's file: the file that Bob wants but its password belongs to Alice
* SA: Alice's password, a single bit.
* SB: Bob's password, a single bits

So what are the conditions necessary for the protocol?

* Simultaneity. 

*What does that mean?*

1. Although one side received the file,  he can not read it until another side confirmed that she received the password.

2. Both of the sides confirmed the passwords are right. As long as one of the password is wrong, the other password must be wrong.

##### Procedure

We mainly take Bob as an example to get the file to be read.

* $n_A$: Alice's public key
* $n_B$: Bob's public key

* Alice send $n_A$ to Bob
* Bob calculates the factorization of $n_A$ in some way.
    - Bob calculates $c = x^2 mod n_A$ and sends $c$ to Alice.
    - Alice inversly infered $x_1$, and send it to Bob.
    - Define: $\upsilon_{B} = \begin{cases}
0& if\ gcd(x-x_1,n_A)= p\ or\ q\\
1& otherwise
\end{cases}$
    - Bob infered if $n_A = p*q$ with probability $\frac{1}{2}$
* Bob send $\epsilon_B = S_B \oplus \upsilon_{B}$ to Alice
    

The last step shows that if the factorization of $n_A$ is right, then Alice can get the correct $S_B = SB$

So the next steps are(last round):

* Alice places her secrets $SA$ as the center bit in $m_A$.
* Alice sends $E_{n_A}(m_A)$  to Bob. 
    - Bob used $n_A, p, q$ to decrypted $E_{n_A}(m_A)$ to obtain $m_A$, then get $SA$
    - Obviously, if $n_A,p,q$ can be infered successly, then Bob get correct $SA$
    - Alice got correct $SB$
* Same as Alice.

#### Remark

* The probability that neither side will obtain the other's secret is $\frac{1}{4}$

Because before the last round terminate, Alice and Bob can not certain whether the factorization of $n_A$ or $n_B$ is right.
