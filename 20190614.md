### Interesting properties

* A bloom filters of a fixed size can represent a set with an arbitrarily large number of elements. However, the false positive rate increases steadily as elements are added until all bits in the filter are set to 1, at which point all queries yield a positive result.
* Union and intersection of Bloom filters with the same size and set of hash functions can be implemented with bitwise OR and AND operations respectively. The intersect operation satisfies a weaker property: the false positive probability in the resulting Bloom filter is at most the false-positive probability in one of the constituent Bloom filters, but may be larger than the false positive probability in the Bloom filter created from scratch using the intersection of the two sets.


### Examples

* Akamai Technologies: prevent "one-hit-wonders" from being stored in its disk caches.
* Google Bigtable, Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra use Bloom filters to reduce the disk lookups for non-existent rows or columns.
* Google Chrome web browser used to use a Bloom filter to identify malicious URLs.???*Can not understand.* 

### Alternatives

* Pagh et al. provide an optimal-space data structure, their data structure has constant locality of reference independent of false positive rate. Also, it allows elements to be deleted without a space penalty, unlike Bloom filters. The same improved properties of optimal space usage, constant locality of reference, and the ability to delete elements are also provided by the *cuckoo filter* of Fan et al.
* Stern & Bill describe a *probabilistic structure based on hash tables, hash compaction*, which Dillinger & Manolios identify as significantly more accurate than a Bloom filter when each is condigured optimally.
* Putze, Sanders & Singler have studied some *variants of Bloom filters* that are either faster or use less space than classic Bloom filters. The basic idea of the fast variant is to locate the k hash values associated with each key into one or two blocks having the same size as processor's memory cache misses. This will presumably improve performance by reducing the number of potential memory cache misses.
* Another alternative to classic Bloom filter is the one based on space efficient variants of *cuckoo hashing*. In this case once the hash table is constructed, the keys stored in the hash table are replaced with short signatures of the keys. 

### Cache filtering

* **Content delivery network**: 

    + deploy web caches around the world to cache and server web content to users with greater performance and reliability. 
    + A key application of Bloom filters is their use in efficiently determining which web objects to store in these web caches. To prevent caching one-hit-wonders, a Bloom filter is used to keep track of all URLs that are accessed by users. 
    + A web object is cached only when it has been accessed at least once before, i.e., the object is cached on its second request. 
    + The use of a Bloom filter in this fashion significantly reduces the disk write workload, since one-hit-wonders are never written to the disk cache.
    + Further, filtering out the one-hit-wonders also saves cache space on disk, increasing the cache hit rates.
* **Avoiding False Positives in a Finite Universe**
    - Kiss et al. described a new construction for the Bloom filter that avoid false positives in addition to the typical non-existence of false negatives. 
    - It relies on existing non-adaptive combinatorial group testing scheme by Eppstein, Goodrich and Hirschberg.

* **Counting filters**
    - Counting filters provide a way to implement a delete operation on a Bloom filter without recreating the filter afresh.
    - the array positions(buckets) are extended from being a single bit to being an n-bit counter.

* **Decentralized aggregation**
    - be origanized in distributed data structures to perform fully decentralized computations of aggregate functions.

* **Bloomier filters**
    - Chazelle et.al designed a generalizetion of Bloom filters that could associate a value with each element that had been inserted, implementing an associative array.(将一个值同被插入的每个元素都联系起来，形成一个关联数组)

* **Data synchronization(数据同步)**
    - used for approximate data synchronization.
    - Counting Bloom filters can be used to approximate the number of differences bwtween two sets.

* **Spatial Bloom filters**
    - Palmieri, Calderoni & Maio proposed Spatial Bloom filters to store location information, especially in the context of cryptographic protocols for location privacy.
    - The main characteristic of SBFs is their ability to store multiple sets in a single data structure.
* **Layered Bloom filters**
    - A layered Bloom filter consists of multiple Bloom filter layers. 
    - Layered Bloom filters allow keeping track of how many times an item was added to the Bloom filter by checking how many layers contain the item.

### Compare-Cuckoo filter

* A cuckoo filter is a space-efficient probability data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set, like a Bloom filter does.
* False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not--- a query returns either "possible in set" or "definitely not in set".
* *A cuckoo filter can also delete existing items.*
* *Cuckoo filters can achieve lower space overhead than space-optimized Bloom filters*.
* *Cuckoo filters have degraded insertion speed after reaching a load threshold when table expanding is recommended. In constrast, Bloom filters can keep inserting new items at the cost of higher false positive rate before expansion.*
* Theory
    - mainly use two hash functions. Arbitrary key can be mapped into two buckets.
    - The key is stored at one of the buckets.
    - Insert key can be stored if there is a empty position. But if no empty, choose one of the postion of bucket, kick out origin key from the bucket and relocate.
